- The journey through Turing is not a competition but rather a collaborative effort on everyones' part towards something bigger.

- There is a big emphasis on asking questions. You will definitely need to ask questions when stuck on something.


-Following the calendar I made and make any changes if necessary for Mod0.
-Use keywords and other search strategies when using Google.


- Shoutout to my girlfriend Kaitlyn who has provided a bunch of emotional support throughout my journey through Turing.
